# 📊 Standard Deviation

*"How far is data from the average?"*

---

## What is it?

Standard Deviation tells you how **spread out** the data is from the mean.

- **Low SD** → Data is close to mean (consistent)
- **High SD** → Data is far from mean (varied)

---

## Formula

```
SD = √Variance

or

SD = √[Σ(x - mean)² / n]
```

---

## Step-by-Step Example

```
Data: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

Step 1: Find Mean
Mean = (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12) / 5 = 8

Step 2: Find differences from mean
4 - 8 = -4
6 - 8 = -2
8 - 8 = 0
10 - 8 = 2
12 - 8 = 4

Step 3: Square the differences
(-4)² = 16
(-2)² = 4
(0)² = 0
(2)² = 4
(4)² = 16

Step 4: Find mean of squares (Variance)
Variance = (16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 5 = 8

Step 5: Square root (Standard Deviation)
SD = √8 = 2.83
```

## Real-Life Example

```
Class A scores: 78, 79, 80, 81, 82  →  SD = 1.4 (consistent)
Class B scores: 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 →  SD = 14.1 (varied)

Both classes have Mean = 80
But Class A students perform similarly.
Class B students have big differences.

## Quick Meaning

| SD Value | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Small** | Data points are close together |
| **Large** | Data points are spread apart |
| **Zero** | All values are the same |
