# 📊 Percentiles and Quartiles

*"Where does your data stand?"*

## What is a Percentile?

A **percentile** tells you what percentage of data falls **below** a certain value.

**Example:**
- You scored in the 90th percentile
- Meaning: You scored better than 90% of people

## Common Percentiles

| Percentile | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 25th (P25) | 25% below, 75% above |
| 50th (P50) | 50% below, 50% above (Median) |
| 75th (P75) | 75% below, 25% above |
| 90th (P90) | 90% below, 10% above |

## What are Quartiles?

**Quartiles** divide data into **4 equal parts** (25% each).

```
Data sorted: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

    Q1          Q2          Q3
    ↓           ↓           ↓
|---25%---|---25%---|---25%---|---25%---|
10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80
         ↑           ↑           ↑
        Q1=25      Q2=45       Q3=65
      (25th %)   (50th %)    (75th %)
```

## Three Quartiles

| Quartile | Also Called | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Q1** | 25th percentile | 25% data below |
| **Q2** | 50th percentile (Median) | 50% data below |
| **Q3** | 75th percentile | 75% data below |

---

## Simple Example

```
Exam scores: 35, 42, 50, 58, 65, 72, 80, 88, 95

Sorted ✓

Q1 (25%) = 46   → 25% scored below 46
Q2 (50%) = 65   → 50% scored below 65 (Median)
Q3 (75%) = 84   → 75% scored below 84
```

---

## IQR (Interquartile Range)

```
IQR = Q3 - Q1

IQR = 84 - 46 = 38

This is the spread of the middle 50% of data.
```

## Real-Life Examples

| Situation | Percentile Use |
|-----------|----------------|
| Baby weight | "Your baby is in 70th percentile" (heavier than 70% of babies) |
| Exam scores | "You're in top 10%" (90th percentile) |
| Salary | "Your salary is at 60th percentile" (earn more than 60%) |
