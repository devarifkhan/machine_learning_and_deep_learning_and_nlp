## What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of learning from data. It helps us collect, organize, analyze, and interpret numbers to make smart decisions.

Think of it like this: You have 1 million customer reviews. You can't read all of them. Statistics helps you understand the *whole story* by looking at patterns and averages.

## The Two Main Branches

### 📥 Descriptive Statistics
*"What does the data look like?"*

| Concept | What It Tells You | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| **Mean** | Average value | Average salary = $50,000 |
| **Median** | Middle value | Half earn above $45,000 |
| **Mode** | Most common value | Most people earn $40,000 |

### 📤 Inferential Statistics
*"What can we predict?"*

| Concept | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Tests if something is true | "Does this medicine work?" |
| **Confidence Interval** | Range where answer likely falls | "Sales will be $90K-$110K" |
| **Regression** | Predicts relationships | "More ads = more sales?" |

## 🎲 Probability
*"How likely is something to happen?"*

```
Flip a coin  → 50% heads
Roll a 6     → 16.7% chance
```

**Why it matters**: Every AI prediction has a probability. "80% chance this is spam."
