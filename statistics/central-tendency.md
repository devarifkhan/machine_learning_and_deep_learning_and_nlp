# 📊 Measures of Central Tendency

*"Finding the center of your data"*

---

## What is it?

A single value that represents the **middle** or **typical** value of a dataset.

---

## Three Types

### 1. Mean (Average)
*Add all values, divide by count*

```
Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

Mean = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50) / 5 = 150 / 5 = 30
```

**Use when:** Data has no extreme values (outliers)

---

### 2. Median (Middle Value)
*Sort data, pick the middle one*

```
Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50  →  Median = 30 (middle)

Data: 10, 20, 30, 40      →  Median = (20 + 30) / 2 = 25
```

**Use when:** Data has extreme values (outliers)

---

### 3. Mode (Most Frequent)
*Value that appears most often*

```
Data: 10, 20, 20, 30, 20  →  Mode = 20 (appears 3 times)

Data: 10, 20, 30, 40      →  No mode (all appear once)
```

**Use when:** Finding most common/popular item

---

## Quick Comparison

| Measure | What it finds | Best for |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Mean** | Average | Normal data, no outliers |
| **Median** | Middle | Data with outliers |
| **Mode** | Most common | Categories, popularity |

---

## Example: Salary Data

```
Salaries: $30K, $35K, $40K, $45K, $500K (CEO)

Mean   = $130K  ❌ (misleading, pulled up by CEO)
Median = $40K   ✅ (true middle)
Mode   = None
```
