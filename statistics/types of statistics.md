# 📊 Types of Statistics

---

## 1. Descriptive Statistics
*"Summarize what you have"*

Describes and organizes data you already collected.

| Measure | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Mean** | Average | 5 students scored: 70, 80, 90, 85, 75 → Mean = 80 |
| **Median** | Middle value | Sorted: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 → Median = 80 |
| **Mode** | Most frequent | Scores: 80, 90, 80, 70, 80 → Mode = 80 |
| **Range** | Spread | Highest - Lowest = 90 - 70 = 20 |

**Use case**: "What's the average age of our users?"

## 2. Inferential Statistics
*"Predict what you don't have"*

Uses a small sample to make conclusions about a larger group.

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Is this true or by chance? | "Does new button increase clicks?" |
| **Confidence Interval** | Range of likely values | "True average is between 78-82" |
| **p-value** | Probability of luck | p < 0.05 = probably real result |
| **Regression** | Predict one thing from another | "Predict sales from ad spend" |

**Use case**: "If 100 users liked feature X, will 10,000 users like it too?"
