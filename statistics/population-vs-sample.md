# 📊 Population vs Sample Data

---

## Population
*"Everyone or everything"*

The **complete** group you want to study.

**Examples:**
- All students in Bangladesh
- All customers of your app
- All cars in Dhaka

**Problem:** Usually too big or expensive to collect data from everyone.

---

## Sample
*"A smaller piece of the population"*

A **subset** selected to represent the whole population.

**Examples:**
- 500 students from 10 schools
- 1,000 randomly selected app users
- 200 cars from different areas

**Why use it:** Faster, cheaper, and still gives accurate results if chosen properly.

## Simple Example

```
🎯 Goal: Find average height of Bangladeshi adults

Population: 170 million people (impossible to measure all)

Sample: Measure 5,000 random people → Average = 5'5"

Conclusion: Average height is approximately 5'5"

## Key Point

> *"A good sample represents the population. A bad sample gives wrong answers."*

**Good sample:** Random, diverse, large enough  
**Bad sample:** Biased, too small, not representative
