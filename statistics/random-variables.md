*"Variables whose values depend on chance"*

## What is a Random Variable?

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is determined by a random event.

You don't know the exact value until the event happens.

**Examples:**
- Flip a coin → Heads or Tails (unknown until flip)
- Roll a dice → 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (unknown until roll)
- Tomorrow's temperature → Could be anything

## Two Types

### 1. Discrete Random Variable
*Countable values, usually whole numbers*

| Example | Possible Values |
|---------|-----------------|
| Dice roll | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 |
| Number of heads in 3 coin flips | 0, 1, 2, 3 |
| Students absent today | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... |

### 2. Continuous Random Variable
*Any value in a range, including decimals*

| Example | Possible Values |
|---------|-----------------|
| Height of a person | 4.5 ft, 5.2 ft, 6.1 ft... |
| Time to finish a task | 2.5 min, 3.7 min... |
| Temperature | 25.3°C, 30.8°C... |

## Quick Comparison

| Discrete | Continuous |
|----------|------------|
| Countable | Measurable |
| Whole numbers | Any number (decimals) |
| Gaps between values | No gaps |
| "How many?" | "How much?" |

---

## Simple Example

```
Random Event: Roll a dice

Random Variable (X) = Number shown on dice

Possible values: X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Each has probability = 1/6
```

## Why It Matters in ML?

| Use Case | Random Variable |
|----------|-----------------|
| Predicting sales | Future sales amount |
| Spam detection | Email is spam (1) or not (0) |
| Weather forecast | Tomorrow's temperature |
